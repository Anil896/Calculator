This is a simple command-line calculator I created using Java. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit. I used the Scanner class to take user input and included basic error handling, especially for division by zero. This project helped me practice Java fundamentals such as methods, conditionals, loops, and user input handling. To run the program, just compile and execute the Calci.java file from the terminal.
